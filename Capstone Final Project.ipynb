    "### Introduction: \n",
    "#### Toronto is the largest city in Canada with population (2016) 2,731,571. And Downtown Toronto is the heart of the city. It has Union Station, headquarters of all big five banks of Canada as well as stadiums of NBA and NHL teams. This project is aim to help well represented franchise Japanese restaurants finding the best place for their restaurant expansion in Downtown Toronto area of city of Toronto. This project will be using k-cluster methodology to find the best neighborhood by considering various factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Location is critical for restaurants. Even good food but with bad location will still hurt the business. However, with so many neighborhoods in a city, it is very time consuming to look into each neighborhood with many different factors like traffic, competitors, scenic spots and so on. Therefore, using k- means clustering is a very good way for finding the top spots and for decision making as well.  "

    "### About the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data for this project will be the same as the project from Week 3. The first source is \"List of postal codes of Canada: M\". It has three columns: Postal code, Borough, Neighbourhood. There are total 16 different neighborhoods in Downtown Toronto area. And the second source is \"https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\" which contains the latitude and longitube of each postal code. The last is Foursqure location data. The methodology will be k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below are some key factors we consider to apply on the results after the clustering:\n",
    "##### 1. A neighborhood that already has some restaurants. This makes sure that the neighborhood is kind of known for food. \n",
    "##### 2. However, we want less similar restaurants in the neighborhood. It is to avoid too much competition at the beginning and also to make the restaurant unique. \n",
    "##### 3. Public transportation. There will be subway and bus stops around. \n",
    "##### 3. Some popular spots around like museums, shopping centers, theatres and hotels. This makes sure the customer traffic including local residents and tourists. "

    "### In Downtown Toronto area, public transportations are very seperated from popular venues from other categories. By looking at the result, only cluster 3 has public transportations in its top 10 common venues. But there are no other entertainments spot in cluster 3, like restaurants, cafe, pub etc. And in the rest of the clusters, no public transportation venues in the top 10 common venues. So in this case, I think we can exclude public transportation from our factor list.  \n",

Cluster 4 and cluster 5 seems to meet the requirement. In cluster 4, we see more western restaurants than Asian restaurants. While in cluster 5, we see the both neighborhoods in it has Asian restaurants on their 2nd most common venues. Also, cluster 4 has much more neighboorhoods than any other clusters, and this makes sure that the population and traffic is huge compared to other clusters. And we also want to avoid some competitions from similar category, so cluster 4 seems to meet our requirement. \n",

It is more diverse compared with other neighborhoods in cluster 4. And this can make sure that there is good amount of traffic but less competition from similar restaurants. "

    "### By examining the clusters and applying our requirements in the chosen cluster, we decided to choose \"St. James Town\" as the location for the restaurant expansion project. This methodology cluster out the neighborhoods and let us easily to apply our requirements on it. This is very helpful on decision making and helpful for business investors to lower the risk of finding bad location. It can also be applied on choosing location for other business from different categories with similar information provided."
