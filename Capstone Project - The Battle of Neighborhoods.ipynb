    "### Backgrouond:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Location is critical for restaurants. Even good food but with bad location will still hurt the business. However, with so many neighborhoods in a city, it is very time consuming to look into each neighborhood with many different factors like traffic, competitors, scenic spots and so on. Therefore, using k- means clustering is a very good way for finding the top spots and for decision making as well.  \n",

    "### About the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data for this project will be the same as the project from Week 3. The first source is \"List of postal codes of Canada: M\". It has three columns: Postal code, Borough, Neighbourhood. There are total 102 different neighborhoods in city of Toronto. And the second source is \"https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\" which contains the latitude and longitube of each postal code. The last is Foursqure location data. The methodology will be k-means clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below are some key factors we consider:\n",
    "##### 1. A neighborhood that already has some restaurants. This makes sure that the neighborhood is kind of known for food. \n",
    "##### 2. However, we want less same kind of restaurants in the neighborhood. It is to avoid too much competition at the beginning and also to make the restaurant unique. \n",
    "##### 3. Public transportation. There will be subway and bus stops around. \n",
    "##### 3. Some popular spots around like museums, shopping centers, theatres and hotels. This makes sure the customer traffic including local residents and tourists. "
